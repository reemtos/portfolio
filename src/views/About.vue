          <p class="paragraph">My name is Tosin, and I'm a front-end developer and designer. My journey as a developer started in February of 2012, my first year in college, where I wrote my first world-renowned <b class="u-text-italic">“Hello World”</b> program in <b class="u-text-italic">QBasic</b>. Over the next 2 years, I started developing for the web, and I built my first website - a music blog - in January of 2015. I started out as a full-stack developer before morphing to front-end development proper.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">I was born on the 31st of July, 1992, and my entire life is centred in Lagos, Nigeria - where I have lived and schooled. I have a <b>Higher National Diploma</b> in <b>Computer Science</b> from the prestigious <b>Yaba College of Technology, Yaba</b>.</p>

        <div class="about-info">
          <p class="paragraph">My first job was in 2012 at <b>SchoolBridge Technologies Limited</b> where I started out as a full-stack developer. I worked with my team members to deliver an <b class="u-text-italic">Education Management Information System (EMIS)</b> and I also single-handedly developed a <b class="u-text-italic">Timesheet Software</b>. Both projects provided my first experience with the web stack (HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript), and helped me understand the concepts of Software Development and Product Management.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">I joined <b>Brande Aristotle Limited</b>, an ad / creative agency, in April of 2016 as a web developer. Here, I built websites along with individual content management systems (CMS) and I provided I.T Support. I picked up my first ever frameworks during this period; <b class="u-text-italic">Twitter Bootstrap</b> for front-end, and <b class="u-text-italic">Laravel</b> for back-end development. I also got an inside scoop of Digital Advertising and Public Relations during my stay.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">In April of 2017, I joined <b>Summitech Computing Limited</b> as a front-end developer. Prior to this move, I began to realise that I had a thing for the look and feel of products, rather than the role of server-side development. I saw the need to carve my niche as a front-end developer in a well-structured environment that would support growth and learning. I have since contributed to, and championed several projects which include websites, web and mobile applications. In addition, I have been able to dive into user interface and user experience design.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">Whether it's translating design mockups into pixel-perfect web and/or mobile screens, or developing user interface from start to finish with no prior design, I enjoy combining the power of appropriate HTML semantics with well-written CSS codes to create good-looking and functional solutions. I'm a sucker for good, comprehensive, maintable and scalable codes, and I enjoy developing from scratch.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">Overtime, I’ve worked with a couple of frameworks - front-end, back-end, web, mobile, Javascript and PHP; all of which I’m quite comfortable with and find very interesting. These frameworks include <b>Vue</b>, <b>Angular</b>, <b>Laravel</b>, <b>Nativescript</b>, <b>Twitter Bootstrap</b> and recently, <b>React</b>. I’m also very familiar and comfortable with a wide variety of development tools, version control systems and libraries such as <b>Git</b>, <b>Gulp</b>, <b>Webpack</b>, <b>NPM</b> and lots more.</p>

        <div class="about-info u-margin-top-small">
          <p class="paragraph">I like to refer to myself as a seasoned front-end mobile and web developer with zero tolerance for mediocrity. I pride myself in my attention to detailness, as well as the quality of my codes and results. My SASS skills are actually impeccable and my knowledge of media queries for mobile responsiveness is just perfect. I cringe when I see terrible designs, improper use of spacing, bad data presentation, layout / structural inconsistency, as well as usability oversights that damage an end-user's experience.</p>

        <div class="about-info">
          <p class="paragraph">My design career started officially in the last quarter of 2017 when I recreated a mockup originally created by a colleague using Sketch. It was my first successful attempt at any design at all, and I have since gotten the hang of it. I enjoy designing for web, creating wireframes, mapping out user flows and interactions, and sometimes, designing for mobile. To help improve myself, I have taken a <b class="u-text-italic">#DesignChallenge</b>, where I refactor and redesign any website / platform of my choice or via recommendations, as the case may be. This was pretty much inspired by <b>Adam Wathan</b> & <b>Steve Schoger</b>'s <a class="link u-text-italic" href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank">Refactoring UI</a>. A number of these works can be found on my <router-link to="/work" class="link">portfolio section</router-link>.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">9 out of 10 times, I start off sketching and wireframing traditionally with pencil and paper, right before switching to design tools. I love and use <b>Sketch</b> all the time, but I’m also comfortable with <b>Figma</b> and <b>Adobe XD</b>. Often times, I use the built-in sketch prototyping tool, and other times I use third-party apps and plugins such as <b>Marvel App</b>, <b>Overflow</b> and <b>Zeplin</b> for collaboration and sharing. I source for design inspiration from a number of places, notably <a class="link" href="https://www.calltoidea.com/" target="_blank">Call To Idea</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.pages.xyz/" target="_blank">Pages</a> and <a class="link" href="https://land-book.com/" target="_blank">Land Book</a>.</p></p>

          <p class="paragraph">What motivates me is the idea of impacting from my knowledge and more importantly, advancing on a personal level. A couple of people and products also inspire me. To mention a few, <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman/" target="_blank">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> has a special place in my heart, forever. His courses pretty much helped me build my confidence as a front-end developer, as well as understanding the importance of writing maintainable and meaningful codes. <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/" target="_blank">Adam Wathan</a> and <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger/" target="_blank">Steve Schoger</a> constantly help me make smarter decisions while designing or developing, and I’m also a huge fan of <a class="link" href="https://www.creative-tim.com/" target="_blank">Creative-Tim</a>’s products and the team behind them.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">My mission is to build products that relieve people of the burden of software development and usage, and my ideal work environment is one where the people are genuinely happy and cheerful, where great products are constantly being developed, and a place where the people appreciate life beyond opening and closing tags.</p>

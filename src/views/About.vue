          <p class="paragraph">Hi again, my name is Tosin and I am a Front-End Developer and Designer. I have been in the business of learning and writing codes for six (6) years now. My journey as a developer started in February of 2012 and my first world-renowned <em>“Hello World”</em> program was written in QBasic. This pretty much kick-started my programming career, and ever since, I have gone from printing <em>Fibonacci series</em> to solving complex problems, and to contributing to enterprise solutions.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">I was born on the 31st of July, 1992. I'm a proud Muslim, an epicurian, a cinephilia and lover of art and music. My entire life is centred in Lagos, Nigeria - where I have lived and schooled, and I have a <b>National Diploma</b> in <b>Computer Science</b> from the prestigious <b>Yaba College of Technology, Yaba</b>.</p>

        <div class="about-info">
          <p class="paragraph">My first job as a developer was in 2012 at <b>SchoolBridge Technologies Limited</b>, a software development company that provided enterprise solutions of different kinds. My role here was pretty much as a full-stack developer; even though I wasn’t familiar with the term as at the time. During my stay, I worked with my team members to deliver an <b class="u-text-italic">Education Management Information System (EMIS)</b> which features Admission & Accommodation Management, Curriculum Management, e-Library and Computer-Based Tests (CBT). I was responsible for Admission and Onboarding Modules for students and clients (schools) respectively. I also single-handedly developed a <b class="u-text-italic">Timesheet Software</b> for tracking, managing and reporting employee activities. Both projects provided my first experience with the web stack (HTML, CSS, PHP, vanilla JavaScript and JQuery), and helped me understand the concepts of Software Development, its complete Life Cycle, as well as Product Management.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">In April of 2016, I joined <b>Brande Aristotle Limited</b> as a web developer. It was an Ad / Creative Agency and I was primarily responsible for website design and development, as well as I.T Support. I picked up my first ever frameworks during this period; Twitter Bootstrap for front-end, and Laravel for back-end development. I built a couple of websites as well as individual content management systems (CMS) for managing each one. I was heavily involved in product management, and also, as a result of the industry they were in, I got an inside scoop of Digital Advertising, Public Relations and general Marketing Concepts.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">In order to establish myself on a particular stack, I joined <b>Summitech Computing Limited</b> in April of 2017, one of the best career decisions I ever made. Prior to this move, it began to dawn on me that I was more inclined to developing and maintaining the look and feel of products, rather than the role of server-side development. I saw the need to carve my niche as a front-end developer in a well-structured environment that would support growth and learning. I have since contributed to, and championed a combined total of six (6) projects, which include websites, web and mobile applications. In addition, I have been able to dive into user interface and user experience design.</p>

        <div class="about-info">
          <p class="paragraph">Whether it's translating design mockups into pixel-perfect web and/or mobile screens, or developing user interface from start to finish with no prior design, I enjoy combining the power of appropriate HTML semantics with well-written CSS codes to create good-looking and functional solutions. I'm a sucker for good, comprehensive, maintable and scalable codes, and I enjoy developing from scratch.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">Overtime, I’ve worked with a couple of frameworks - front-end, back-end, web, mobile, Javascript and PHP; all of which I’m quite comfortable with and find very interesting. These frameworks include Vue, Angular, Laravel, Nativescript, Twitter Bootstrap and recently, React. I’m also very familiar and comfortable with a wide variety of development tools, version control systems and libraries such as Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, NPM and lots more.</p>

        <div class="about-info u-margin-top-small">
          <p class="paragraph">I like to refer to myself as a seasoned front-end mobile and web developer with zero tolerance for mediocrity. I pride myself in my attention to detailness, as well as the quality of my codes and results. My SASS skills are actually impeccable and my knowledge of media queries for mobile responsiveness is just perfect. I cringe when I see terrible designs, improper use of spacing, bad data presentation, layout / structural inconsistency, as well as usability oversights that damage an end-user's experience.</p>

        <div class="about-info">
          <p class="paragraph">My design career started officially in the last quarter of 2017 when I recreated a mockup originally created by a colleague using Sketch. It was my first successful attempt at any design at all, and I have since gotten the hang of it. I enjoy designing for web, creating wireframes, mapping out user flows and interactions, as well as designing for mobile. In a bit to better myself, I have taken a design challenge tagged <b class="u-text-italic">#DesignChallenge</b>, where I refactor and redesign any website or platform of my choice, and often times from recommendations, as the case may be. This was pretty much inspired by <b class="u-text-italic">Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger's Refactoring UI</b>. A number of these works can be found on my <router-link to="/work" class="link">portfolio section</router-link>.</p>

        <div class="about-info u-margin-top-small">
          <p class="paragraph">9 out of 10 times, I start off sketching and wireframing traditionally with pencil and paper, right before switching to design tools. I love and use Sketch all the time, but I’m also comfortable with Figma and Adobe XD. Often times, I use the built-in sketch prototyping tool, and other times I use third-party apps and plugins such as Marvel App, Overflow and Zeplin for collaboration and sharing.</p>

        <div class="about-info">
          <p class="paragraph">What motivates me is the idea of impacting from my knowledge and of course, continous learning. I spend a lot of time learning ways to improve my design and development skills. I get excited about new episodes of <a class="link" href="https://refactoringui.com/" target="_blank">Refactoring UI</a> and I source for inspiration from a number of places, notably <a class="link" href="https://www.calltoidea.com/" target="_blank">Call To Idea</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.pages.xyz/" target="_blank">Pages</a>, <a class="link" href="https://land-book.com/" target="_blank">Land Book</a> and <a class="link" href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribble</a>.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">A couple of people and products also inspire me. To mention a few, <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman/" target="_blank">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> has a special place in my heart, forever. His courses pretty much helped me build my confidence as a front-end developer, as well as understanding and writing maintable and meaningful codes. I’m also a huge fan of <a class="link" href="https://www.creative-tim.com/" target="_blank">Creative-Tim</a>’s products and their people.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph">My mission is to build products that relieve people of the burden of software development and/or usage, and my ideal work environment is one where the people are genuinely happy and cheerful, where great products are constantly being developed, and a place where the people appreciate life beyond opening and closing tags.</p>
